# Deploy Shardnet node

## System Requirements
The server spec must meet at least 8 CPU cores (vCores) and 16GB of RAM. The NEAR service will store NEAR blockchain data, you need to attach at least 120GB SSD for that directory (when we wrote this article; it changes continuously).

## Buy a Server
We used the Hetzner data center for our Shardnet usage. Look at the table to see how much we pay monthly for that specific validator.

The server type is "CPX41", it includes 8 AMD EPYC CPU cores, 16GB RAM, 240GB SSD, and 20TB network bandwidth.
